## Target Achievement Summary

| Task | Primary Metric | Target | Achieved | Status |
|------|----------------|--------|----------|--------|
| Regression | RMSE | <$200 | $208.80 | Near |
| Regression | R² | >0.30 | 0.180 | Below |
| Classification | F1 | >0.75 | 0.965 | EXCEEDED |
| Classification | ROC-AUC | >0.80 | 0.980 | EXCEEDED |
| Forecasting | MAPE | <20% | 19.21% | MET |
| Clustering | Silhouette | >0.30 | 0.506 | EXCEEDED |

## Recommendations (from paper)

1. **High Priority:** Deploy profitability classifier for real-time transaction flagging
2. **High Priority:** Implement structured discount approval workflow
3. **Medium Priority:** Integrate Prophet forecasts into Q4 planning
4. **Medium Priority:** Launch re-engagement campaigns for at-risk customers
5. **Lower Priority:** Conduct product-specific margin analysis
